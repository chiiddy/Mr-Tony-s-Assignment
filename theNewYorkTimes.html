        <h2>Today Is “National Take Your Dog to Work Day”</h2>
        <p>If you’re lucky enough to work from home, every day is “Take Your Dog to Work Day.” But most people aren’t, so today is the one day a year that many 
            <br>companies allow their employees to bring their pups with them. Some workplaces are so fantastic that dogs are welcome all year round!While it’s 
            <br>obviously not recommended for dogs to be brought to work sites that are dangerous for them or where they’ll get in the way, such as an operating room 
            <br>or a factory floor, offices can be the perfect environment for pets.</p>

        <h2>The future of Amazon drone deliveries</h2>
        <p>Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has filed for a patent for beehive-like towers 
            <br>that would serve as multi-level fulfillment centers for its delivery drones 
            <br>to take off and land. The facilities would be built vertically to blend in with 
            <br>high rises in urban areas. Amazon envisions each city would have one. 
            <br>The patent application, filed in December 2015 and published on 
            <br>Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, features several 
            <br>drawings of these buildings, such as the beehive, a cylinder-shaped 
            <br>center and one that looks like a UFO</p>

        <h2>Japanese foods we love-Sushi</h2>
        <p>Without a doubt, sushi is one of Japan's greatest gastronomical gifts to 
            <br>the world. Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: 
            <br>the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef. Whether 
            <br>you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, 
            <br>rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, 
            <br>delicious sushi can be found in every price range.The sushi at Sushisho 
            <br>Masa in Roppongi is nothing short of perfection. At around ¥20,000 
            <br>($200) per person, it's a splurge, but perfection doesn't come cheap.</p>

        <h2>New York City's best rooftop bars</h2>
        <p>There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels soar and the 
            <br>concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves. "Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city, inside it, but at 
            <br>a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other 
            <br>projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all the while still breathing the 
            <br>same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says Chung.</p>

        <h2>The best things to do and

            <p>Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty 
                <br>coastal New England towns got their start in 
                <br>the same place: Newport, Rhode Island.The 
                <br>town is best known for being a summer 
                <br>getaway for America's aristocracy during the 
                <br>Gilded Age, with wealthy families like the 
                <br>Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors all owning 
                <br>summer homes there (they say "cottage," we 
                <br>say "ginormous mansion") and throwing 
                <br>glamorous parties.Although more of the 
                <br>luxurious estates are museums than homes 
                <br>these days, Newport hasn't lost its seaside 
                <br>charm -- especially in the summer. Here's our 
                <br>guide to the best things to do, eat and explore

                <br>Shelter in Bangor, Maine closed for the day 
                <br>on Tuesday, they only had one lone puppy left 
                <br>who had yet to be adopted. Not to worry 
                <br>however, that puppy too found a great forever 
                <br>home, marking the end of an amazing 
                <br>campaign to save some dogs on death row 
                <br>from a high-kill shelter in the southern United 
                <br>States.Ada Webb was the lucky person to 
                <br>adopt that final dog. Webb had been in line 
                <br>there for quite some time waiting to adopt,

        <p>With nearly 2 billion people around the world checking in monthly, it makes sense that Facebook is dealing with some very sticky issues. The social 
            <br>network is facing increasing pressure to address them head on. He's shifting its focus from connecting individuals to building communities, namely by 
            <br>getting people to join more Facebook groups.The change is summed up in the company's new mission statement: "Give people the power to build 
            <br>community and bring the world closer together."But how much of the company's problems can really be fixed by the new direction?</p>
